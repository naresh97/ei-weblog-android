        My name is Naresh and I am doing my Master\'s in Automation at the HSD.\n
        \nI wrote this app because I was unsatisfied with the EI weblog that was always silently being
        updated. The other option would be to develop enough self-discipline to check it regulary.
        Yeah no thanks.\n
        \nI put too many hours of work into this app, and if you like it and found it useful, I would really
        appreciate it if you bought me a beer, or maybe a tasty d√∂ner.
